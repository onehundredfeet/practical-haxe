# practical-haxe

After a year of working with haxe, here's a few things i wish i'd known at the start

# recommended libraries

there are lots of long lists of libs, but i'm going to try to recommend only one, at most two for a given category.

## Macros
* tink macro - when used properly, makes macros easier to write.

# async

* pecan

## native extension shims
* ammer
*h-idl
